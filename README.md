Welcome to the Registrations Lite project Repository!

Project Outline
---------------
Primary repository for the Registrations Lite project. This project will be split into two sections to begin with, the client side application and the API data server. We may in future extend this component set to include a further interface to the API layer, this will mainly concern itself with configuration setup.

Meeting
-------
We intend for this project to be undertaken every Friday during lunch break. Any and all are welcome to join. No catch up sessions are planned at this point and this repository is proposed as the current template for work as it moves forward.

* Javascript (es2015+)

* NodeJs
* ReactJS
