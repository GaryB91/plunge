As an event organiser, I want to:

* take entries within my website, so that my website is considered a one-stop-shop for my event

* collect contact details about entrants, so that I can contact them prior the event

* collect personal informatiom about entrants, so that I can collect demographic information

* ask entrants event related questions, so that I can collect essential event-related informatiom

* show all the event tickets that are available, so that entrants can choose the right tickt for them


As an entrant, I want to:

* create an account, so my personal details are saved for future use

* sign in with an existing account, so that I can use my saved personal details

* see the steps that I need to carry out to create an entry, so that I understand the whole process

* be told when there are errors in the information that I provide, so that I can provide valid information

* be told when I have omitted information from my entry, so that I can provide complete information

* see how far along the entry process I am, so that I can monitor my progress

* create an entry for more than one person, so that I can enter my friends and family at the same time as myself

* be able to partially complete entry, so that I do not have to complete it all in one go

* be able to resume my partially complete entry, so that I do not have to re-enter information I previously entered

* review my collection of entries before I submit it, so that I can ensure I am submitting the correct information

* receive a confirmation email when my transaction is complete, so that I am certain that my entry has been received
